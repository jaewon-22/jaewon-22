**AI/ML Engineer**
Seoul, South Korea | London, UK

Building practical intelligence systems that are fast, useful, and production‑ready.
I focus on LLMs, finetuning, model integrations, scalable inference, and real‑world deployment — using AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, and modern Python tooling.

I enjoy taking models from research → product, improving latency, reducing cost, and delivering AI features that actually ship.
